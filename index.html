                        I'm Ryan Somerfield. I have a Master Degree in Systems Engineering and I have a passion for automation. I love Systems Engineering because it is at the intersection of Hardware and Software. I have over 2 years of experience developing hardware and software. I am currently working as an Applications Engineer at Precise Automation, a collaborative robotics manufacturer, where I develop hardware and software solutions, troubleshoot customer problems, and play with some of the coolest robots being built today.

                    <p class="text-left">
                        I am originally from the suburbs of Chicago, Illinois. I attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign for both undergraduate and graduate school in Systems Engineering. After grad school, I moved out to the Bay Area to be among the best and brightest minds working in cutting edge industries. Having a background in Systems Engineering, I am comfortable working with both hardware and software, but I have a slight preference to software.

                    <p class="text-left">
                       I have a strong desire to constantly learn and grow, and I'm constantly exploring new areas of interest. It is likely that I've learned something new since updating this website, but here is a list of some of my past interests!
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="emphasize-text">Machine Learning</span> - Machine Learning is such a fun and dynamic field, and recently I have been especially interested in Reinforcement Learning and Deep Learning. I am developing a reinforcement learning environment to experiment with Deep Q Learning before tackling other variations of machine learning.</li>
                        <li><span class="emphasize-text">Autonomous Vehicles</span> - I have been interested in Autonomous Vehicles for quite some time. As a Masters Student, I programmed an Autonomous Vehicle Lane Detection and Control Algorithm for a miniature differential drive vehicle.</li>
                        <li><span class="emphasize-text">Robotics</span> - In a similar way to Autonomous Vehicles, I have been interested in Robotics since I was a kid. At University of Illinois, I worked in a lab developing control, path planning algorithms, and working with various different sensors related to robotics. </li>
                        <li><span class="emphasize-text">Automation</span> - In general, my interests are focused around the task of automating. Whether its creating an efficient API to help program a system, developing an embedded systems application to solve a problem, or just writing software for the fun of it, I tend to put myself through a great deal of work in the name of automation!</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="container col-md-6 col-sm-6">
                    <h4><span class="emphasize-text">Non-Technical Interests</span></h4>
                    <p class="text-left">
                        When I am not learning something new or working on a project, here are some of the things I enjoy doing:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="emphasize-text">Competitive Running</span> - I have run competitively since I was 10 years old. I ran collegiately for the University of Illinois Club and have now set my sights on the marathon. If you're a running nerd, you can follow me on <a href="http://www.strava.com/athletes/ryan_somerfield">Strava</a>. My long-term goal is to run in every single state in the US. My personal bests are 4:26 in the mile, 15:51 in the 5k, and 1:15:23 in the half marathon.</li>
                        <li><span class="emphasize-text">Hiking/Camping</span> - I enjoy spending time in nature. Currently, I've been to ~10 National Parks in the US. Being from the Midwest, I got a slow start, but I'm hoping to visit all of them!</li>
                        <li><span class="emphasize-text">Photography</span> - I am only a beginner at photography, but I still like to capture memories. I primarily like to capture nature on hikes and runs, and moments from trips that I have taken. I have a Canon Rebel T7i and a GoPro action camera for my runs.</li>
                        <li><span class="emphasize-text">Socializing</span> - When I'm not running, racing, hiking, or traveling, I enjoy checking out a local restaurant or brewery. I like tasting new IPAs and Ales, but my favorite has always been the Domaine DuPage from back in Illinois!</li>
